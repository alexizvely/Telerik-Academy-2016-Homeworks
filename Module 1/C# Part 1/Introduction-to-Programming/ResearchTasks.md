Programming Languages
============
### Provide a short list with information about the most popular programming languages ###
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) -> an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers
* [Java](http://eclipsetutorial.sourceforge.net/totalbeginner.html) -> a general-purpose computer programming language designed to produce programs that will run on any computer system
* [Swift](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/an-absolute-beginners-guide-to-swift) -> a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language created for iOS, OS X, watchOS, tvOS and Linux development by Apple Inc
* [Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) -> a high-level general-purpose programming language

### How similar are they to C# ###
> Both C# and JavaScript are Cross-platform.

> Both Java and C# share the same general C++-style syntax, support distributed programming, and utilize the same object model.

> Both Swift and C# are type safe languages. Syntax wise, swift seems a cousin to C#.

> Python: Both languages are strongly typed.

### How do they differ from C# ###
> Javascript is a non-typed scripting language, which means it typically runs uncompiled in browsers. C# is a strongly-typed language, which is typically compiled into a .dll. 

> Java doesn't have operator and conversion overloading. Java doesn't have expression trees. [`more info`](http://stackoverflow.com/a/295248)

> Swift is not Cross-Platform.

> Python is a scripting language. Python is not compiled language and does not include a compiler, while C# does.

Development Environments
============

### Provide a short list with popular development environments (IDEs) ###

* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) -> a cross-platform source code editor with a Python application programming interface (API). It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, and its functionality can be extended by users with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses
* [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) -> a lightweight JavaScript IDE, equipped for client-side development and server-side development with Node.js
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/) -> an integrated development environment (IDE) containing a suite of software development tools developed by Apple for developing software for OS X and iOS
* [Atom](https://atom.io) -> a free and open-source text and source code editor for OS X, Linux, and Windows with support for plug-ins written in Node.js, and embedded Git Control, developed by GitHub. Atom is a desktop application built using web technologies. Most of the extending packages have free software licenses and are community-built and maintained
* [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/downloads/) -> an integrated development environment that contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. Eclipse is written mostly in Java and its primary use is for developing Java applications, but it may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages through the use of plugins.

C# and .NET Differences
============
### Describe the difference between C# and .NET Framework in 2-3 sentences ###

>.NET is an umbrella term which comprises of FCL (Framework Class Library) and many languages(C#, VB.NET, C++/CLI,...),  which compiles source code and outputs IL (Intermediate Language). IL will be consumed by CLR (Common Language Runtime) and converts it into platform specific code during runtime by the JIT (just-in-time) compiler.

> C# is a programming language using which you can develop software utilizing the FCL and can target many platforms (Windows, Linux - using Mono, iOS - using Xamarin, ...)
